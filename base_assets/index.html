      <h3>How to get started</h3>
      When you launch the application, a new map is automatically created. You can start placing tiles on it by
      exploring the side menu containing the basic tiles automatically built into the software. To save your map, simply
      open the "map" menu located above the map and click on "save". You've created your first map! To go even further,
      you can create your own tiles that you can then place on your maps. To do this, simply open the "Tile mode" side
      tab, create your tile in the same way as you created your map, then save it by clicking on the "Tile" menu above
      the grid and then "Save". You can now return to the "Map mode" tab and use your own tile. Similarly, you can
      create your own blueprints by opening a new map, drawing your blueprint using tiles, then saving it under
      'Blueprint' then 'Save'. They will then appear in the 'Blueprints' category of the 'Map mode' side tab.
      <h3>Main features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h4>Top menu:</h4>

          The top menu allows you to manipulate your data:
          <ul id="top">
            <li>The "Project" tab lets you manage a project, which is a folder containing all your maps. When you open a
              new
              project or load an existing one, it will appear in the 'Project' tab on the side. In this tab, you can
              link maps
              to your project, which will appear in the tab. You can use "Delete" to completely delete a project.</li>
            <li>The 'Map' tab lets you manage your maps. You can open a new blank map with 'New', load a saved map with
              'Load',
              save a map with 'Save' and delete a saved map with 'Delete'.</li>
            <li>The 'Tile' tab lets you manage your custom tiles. You can open a new blank grid and switch to "Tile
              mode" using
              "New", load a saved tile so that you can modify it using "Load", save a tile that you have created using
              "Save"
              and delete a saved tile using "Delete".</li>
            <li>The "Blueprint" tab lets you manage your custom blueprints. You can open a new blank map with 'New',
              load a saved
              blueprint so that you can modify it with 'Load', save a blueprint that you have created with 'Save' so
              that it
              appears in the 'Blueprints' category of the 'Map mode' tab, and delete a saved blueprint with 'Delete'.
            </li>
            <li>The "Edit" tab lets you undo an action with "Undo" or redo an action with "Undo".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Side menu:</h4>
          <ul id="side">
            <li>
              The "Map mode" menu contains all the elements you can use to create a map, predefined tiles included in
              the
              software, user tiles and blueprints created by the user.</li>
            <li>The "Tile mode" menu contains all the tools needed to create custom tiles, with the option of choosing a
              colour or
              creating your own using the RGB buttons. You can store up to 10 custom colours.</li>
            <li>The "settings" menu contains the customisation options you need to use the software, such as the ability
              to
              delete, hide or display the grid on top of the tiles. You can also choose the scrolling speed in the "Map
              mode"
              menus.</li>
            <li>The 'Project' menu displays the name of the current project if one is open, as well as the names of the
              maps
              inside.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
      <ul>

        <li>CTRL-y: Redo</li>
        <li>Arrows: Move the map</li>
